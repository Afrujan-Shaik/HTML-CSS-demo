            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web.
                 It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
                 Other technologies besides HTML are generally used 
                 to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS)
                  or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                  Images can make a page look more appealing and captivating. 
                  One of such ways for making the page more attractive is adding background image to it.
                   You can add backgrond image in HTML by using two methods:
                  Background attribute (Html Tag) and Internal Style Sheet (CSS).
                "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, 
                either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. 
                By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people,
                 you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
